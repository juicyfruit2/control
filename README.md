# control

- This is going to expand on the first control structure task we created.
- Write code to take in a user’s age using input() and store their age in an integer variable called age.
- Then check if the user’s age is 18 or older. If the user is 18 or older, print out the message “You are old enough!”.
- Else if they are over 16 but under 18, print “Almost there”.
- Otherwise print “You’re just too young!”.
- You should use one if, elif and else statement to do this
